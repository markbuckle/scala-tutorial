### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag by running the following in the repo folder:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to see the final code

The master branch contains the final code, so you can download the repository as is, or if you've navigated somewhere in the code history, then do

```
git checkout master
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the videos. Prior to each video, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `basics`
* `object-orientation`
* `functional-programming`
* `pattern-matching`
* `advanced`
